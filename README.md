**VisionNet: Human Detection and Pose Analysis:**  

 
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/human-detection-dataset/

> VisionNet is a collaborative project by Team 3 focused on building robust and efficient models for human detection and pose analysis using deep learning. This repository includes the implementation of three convolutional neural networks (AlexNet, VGG, and a third model TBD) to classify images for the presence of humans. For images containing humans, further processing is performed for object detection and pose estimation.  
>
> **Key Features:**
> - Utilizes the Human Detection Dataset featuring CCTV footage in diverse environments.
> - Implements standardized image preprocessing (resizing, normalization).
> - Includes training, validation, and testing for AlexNet and VGG models.
> - Incorporates object detection and pose estimation for classified images.
>
> **Applications:** ....
>
> **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and more.
